# UtilityLibrary

This repository contains a collection of Java classes and methods that offer algorithmic solutions to problems that recurrently appear in coding challenges. Some examples of these solutions are the following:

(1) A method that implements binary search, which can be used any time we require a fast algorithm for searching in a sorted array of keys.
(2) A generic backtracking algorithm, which can be easily adapted to context any time we need a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a search space.
(3) A breadth-first search algorithm, which offers a systematic way to visit every edge and vertex of a graph.
