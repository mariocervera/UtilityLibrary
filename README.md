# Utility Library

This repository contains a collection of Java classes and methods that offer algorithmic solutions for problems that recurrently appear in coding challenges. Some examples of these solutions are the following:

(1) A method that implements binary search, which can be used every time we need a fast algorithm for searching in a sorted array of keys.

(2) A generic backtracking algorithm, which can be easily adapted to context to obtain a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a search space.

(3) A breadth-first search algorithm for visiting every edge and vertex of a graph.
