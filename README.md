# Utility Library

This repository contains algorithmic solutions for problems that recurrently appear in coding challenges. These solution are, therefore, intended to be easily reusable. Some examples of these solutions are the following:

(1) A binary search algorithm, which can be used every time we need to search (efficiently) in a sorted array of keys.

(2) A generic backtracking algorithm, which can be easily adapted to context to obtain a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a search space.

(3) A breadth-first search and a depth-first search algorithm for visiting every edge and vertex of a graph.
